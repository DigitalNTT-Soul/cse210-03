# HiLo
HiLo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher (Hi) or lower (Lo) than the previous one. You are the player, and the program is the dealer. Points are won 
or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly. Don't let your point total hit zero, or its game over! The good new is, you can always start another round :) 

## Getting Started

browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

```
python3 hilo
```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the
project folder. Select the main module inside the hilo folder and click the "run" button.

There are some rules to this game and are listed as follows:

- Individual cards are represented as a number from 1 to 13.
- The current card is displayed.
- The player guesses if the next one will be higher or lower.
- The next card is displayed.
- The player earns 100 points if they guessed correctly.
- The player loses 75 points if they guessed incorrectly.
- If a player reaches 0 points the game is over.
- If a player has more than 0 points they decide if they want to keep playing.
- If a player decides not to play again the game is over.
